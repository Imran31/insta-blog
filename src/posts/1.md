# Why I built this blog?
`May 31st 2021`

I've struggled with completing mini projects and this is one of the many attempts of building a personal blog. I'll admit it feels good finally coming through with it. On March 1st(2021) I left my job at Wmall to go on a sabbatical for 4 months. Is it normal for someone with only a couple years experience to get this priviledge? I am not sure but I will not take my CTOs kindness for granted, thank you Anubhav. 

I built this blog to document honest and cool parts of me. 

*Here we go*.

## UI Design

I bet you could tell this design isn't original. I **reverse engineered** aka *stole it* from Instagram. The design is minimal and managable to achieve with my technical skills. I wanted a good reference for a responsive design and Instagram is my favourite UX. This was my first ever project where I used `styled-components` and just generally used `CSS`. As a backend developer, it's not as scary as I believed it to be.

The biggest challenge and most fun component to build was the *Story Highlights*. I originally intended to build it on my own but I found this [lovely library](https://github.com/mohitk05/react-insta-stories#readme) on github. 

## Framework

I used Gatsby for building this. I owe a lot to the tutorials, the sections of adding markdown pages automatically are the backbone of this blog. I already knew Javascript since I used Nodejs at work and was familiar with some React concepts. Using GraphQL has been *interesting*. I wonder how complex it gets in larger projects like Instagram. 

## What's with the domain name?

Back in highschool we had an assignment for Shakespeare to enact a scene from any of his works. I didn't want to be another *To be or not to be* monologue and found this [Al Pacino speech in Merchant of Venice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th7euZ30wDE). Not to brag but I killed it and got an encore to perform in other sections of my grade. I bought the domain name about a year ago and I'm glad I will finally put it to use.
